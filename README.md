# Note about the author
Please note that this project may not be fully optimized or streamlined, as it was developed by an amateur programmer with a passion for coding. As such, there may be more efficient ways to achieve the same results. However, this project is intended to serve as a learning opportunity and a demonstration of basic web development concepts, such as using APIs to fetch and display data on a web page, and building a simple web app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Flask.
