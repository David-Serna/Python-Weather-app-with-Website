# How-To-Use

To use the Weather app, first download the "Darkmode (download this)" directory from the GitHub repository. Then, navigate to the directory in your terminal or command prompt and run the app.py file using your Python environment. This will start a local web server and open a web page in your default web browser or DE of choice (e.g. PyCharm's built-in web server).

To check the weather for a city, enter the name of the city in the "Enter a city name" input box and click the "Get Weather" button. The app will display the current weather information for that city, including temperature, wind speed, and time of day.

# Note about the author
Please note that this project may not be fully optimized or streamlined, as it was developed by an amateur programmer with a passion for coding. As such, there may be more efficient ways to achieve the same results. However, this project is intended to serve as a learning opportunity and a demonstration of basic web development concepts, such as using APIs to fetch and display data on a web page, and building a simple web app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Flask.
